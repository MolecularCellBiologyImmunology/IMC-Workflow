Notes: 
Why normalization?
Normalization is required in Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) to mitigate technical variability that arises independently of biological differences.
IMC signal intensity is influenced by multiple non-biological factors, including laser ablation efficiency, plasma stability, detector sensitivity, metal isotope–specific transmission, and slide-to-slide or run-to-run staining variability.
These sources of variation can lead to systematic differences in signal intensity across regions of interest, slides, or acquisition batches, even when identical tissues or markers are measured. Without normalization,
such technical fluctuations may confound quantitative comparisons of marker expression,obscure true biological patterns, and introduce batch-driven artifacts in downstream single-cell and spatial analyses.
Normalization is therefore applied to harmonize signal intensities across comparable samples while preserving genuine biological heterogeneity, 
enabling robust comparison of marker expression across regions, samples, and experimental conditions.
